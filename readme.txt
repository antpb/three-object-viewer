A WordPress plugin for drag and drop 3D content creation compatible with most XR devices.

== Description ==
Welcome to the metaverse, WordPress!
The Three Object Viewer plugin is a drag and drop way to publish virtual worlds or 3D content using your WordPress site. The plugin supports AR VR and 2D in a browser window and runs React Three Fiber under the hood with support for the three-omi audio emitter extension.

## Drag and drop WebXR
The three object viewer plugin makes it possible to drag and drop 3D (glb) files into your WordPress block editor content. Wherever you can put a block, you can put a virtual world.
Your website can truly become a virtual world when your visitors click the “Enter in VR” button. When a user enters the scene, they will have the ability to teleport throughout the environment. More exciting VR features to come!

## Implements Open Metaverse Interoperability Extensions
This plugin supports the three-omi package built by contributors of the Open Metaverse Interoperability group. As new extensions are added, this plugin will be updated to support those features. Some potential components in the future include physics and collision events.

## Currently Supported Three OMI Extensions

KHR_audio – Play both spatial and global audio in your scenes by creating a scene here in the build.xpportal.io Spoke editor. From there you can export a glb file that supports the Three OMI Audio Emitter Extension.

== Changelog ==
= 1.1.0 =
Fixed: Controller was loading characters too high. Scale has changed so scenes may need to be verified to be as previously saved.
Fixed: VRM objects will load with an idle animation.
Added: New editor sidebar for selecting objects in the editor.
Added: Press F now when in the editor
Added: Hold shift while moving to run.

= 1.0.9 =
Fixed: Spawn - Spawn block now properly loads a player in the spawn location.
Added: Initial support for OMI_spawn_point.

= 1.0.8 =
Added: Click event for audio objects that contain KHR_audio. Improvements to come. To set a KHR_audio object to be interactable simply make the object collibable.
Added: Video - Interactions to play/pause a video. A paused video will now show a play icon to resume the video source. Video audio to come soon!
Added: Portal - VR interactions for Portal block. Now clicking on the portal block will take you to the destination.
Fixed: Video - autoPlay property was not being properly respected.
Fixed: Model and Environment Block - Animations were previously broken since the launch of the Environment Block. All should be good now with the caviat that you cannot use the same object twice in a scene. An update will fix this very soon.
Fixed: Sky Block - fixed issue where teleportation to the sky was possible. Stay on the ground!

= 1.0.7 =
Fix: removes wp_texturize that was breaking url strings on the front end.

= 1.0.6 =
Fix: Sky blocks were causing incredibly poor performance in VR. This is fixed by using a more optimized primitive for the skybox.

= 1.0.5 =
Added: Openbrush support in the Model Block and Three Object Block. To use, add a Model Block to a scene and select a Tilt Brush glb file. Plugin can be downloaded at: https://github.com/xpportal/three-object-viewer-three-icosa/releases/tag/0.1.1
Fix: Initialize text at a better size when adding a Text Block

= 1.0.4 =
Fix: Scaling and alignment of Portal text was not true on the front end to what was saved in the editor. This update fixes the text positining and centers it to the object's 0,0,0 position.

= 1.0.3 =
Fix: Removes collider debug.

= 1.0.2 =
Fix: Environment block settings were not respected on the front end. Should be good now!
Fix: range controls in the Environment block were in a broken flex.

= 1.0.1 =
Environment blocks without a OMI collider will be treated as a trimesh collider. This means that every item used in the Environment block will be collidable/walkable.

Image Block Edit Controls now update correctly. Fixed a bug where an image would return to its previous location after chaging position.


= 1.0.0 =
New Environment Block for building feature rich experiences. This is the start to something big. 

3D Image Block- The Image block enables position and rotation settings for any image pulled from your media library. Support for transparency and a future update will include the ability to set external urls as the source.- 3D Video Block- Similar to image, the video block enables content creators to select video assets from the Media Library to attach to a plane in 3D space. I plan to add the ability to select external urls as well as custom mesh objects to render video on. The block can be paused and played by focusing your view in the direction of the video and clicking.

3D Model Block- The model block supports adding usdz, vrm, and glb files to your environment. This block has the ability to loop animations and be set to collidable so visitors can walk on the mesh surface.

Spawn Point Block- define where your visitors land when they enter your world.

Portal Block- Enable metaverse traversal or dive deeper into your site using urls and collidable objects to trigger traversal. There are settings to control the label and positioning of the label so your visitors know where they are going. This is going to be revamped after release to bring a prompt before traversing to ensure no unintended behavior.

Text Block- Use the text block to add text content inside of your worlds. You can define a color, position, and scale of the block of text. There will be more parameters in future updates.

3D Sky Block- Wrap your world in a 360 spherical panoramic to simulate skies

More to come! V1 will almost certainly be buggy, but please report any issues at github.com/antpb/three-object-viewer
